# Flight Logbook

Something I've needed to write for many years. Moving my current flight logbook from Excel to <probably> a flat database, with automated hour calculations for aircraft/operation/location etc.

* ToDo Initial ingestion from csv and cli functionality.
* ToDo Simple web based frontend for ease of flight entry and statistics displays

This projects first iteration has been a result of a [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/) Personal Project
